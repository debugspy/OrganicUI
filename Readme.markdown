### ORWindow	

#### Blackened Window with Disappearing Title Bar

ORWindow is my first attempt to recreate the title bar effect from Quicktime X. This was done for a game where I wanted the focus to be only on the game content, nothing else in the window.

Normally, the title bar is hidden, but it becomes visible when the mouse moves over it.

I would like to improve this, there are two main outstanding issues:

1.  The window buttons do not react to mouse movement.
2.  The title bar could look a lot better.

License
-------

A license hasn't been decided on, but I believe this code has the most utility when it is improved by those who use it for whatever purpose.

When you use it, a mention would be appreciated, although not required.
